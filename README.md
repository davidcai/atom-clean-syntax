# Emerald Dream Syntax

Syntax theme for Atom Editor. Works best with dark themes such as [Atom Material UI](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui).

Inspired by ColorSublime [Chelevra theme](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Chelevra) by Jonas Hermsmeler.

The name of this theme is to honor the [Druid class](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/class/druid) in the World of Warcraft.

- Green - Wood
- Blue - Water
- White - Air
- Orange - Earth

Yes, there is no Fire. That belongs to Pyro Mage.
